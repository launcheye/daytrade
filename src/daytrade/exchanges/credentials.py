"""API credential loading and the key-permission safety policy.

This module is the gatekeeper for exchange API keys. Two rules are absolute
and cannot be configured away:

1. **No withdrawal access, ever.** A key whose verified permissions include
   withdrawal is rejected outright — the platform must never be able to move
   money off an exchange.
2. **Testnet only.** Keys are loaded exclusively from ``*_TESTNET_*`` env
   variables and are only ever used against testnet endpoints.

By default keys must also be *read-only* (no trade scope) — pure monitoring.
Placing sandbox orders requires the operator to explicitly lower
``sandbox.require_read_only_keys``; even then, withdrawal access stays banned.
