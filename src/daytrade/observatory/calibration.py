"""Confidence calibration — making the strategy's stated confidence honest.

The live diagnosis showed the strategy was systematically overconfident:
when it said "65% sure" it was right only ~53% of the time. An overconfident
signal makes a confidence threshold meaningless — the gate lets through
trades that only *look* strong.

This fits an isotonic-regression map from *stated* confidence to *empirical*
accuracy, learned from the strategy's own evaluated prediction history. This
is the standard fix for an overconfident classifier (see scikit-learn's
probability-calibration docs); isotonic regression is used because it can
correct any monotonic distortion and there is ample history to fit it.

Until there is enough evaluated history the calibrator is the identity map —
it never invents a correction it cannot support. Paper / simulation only.
