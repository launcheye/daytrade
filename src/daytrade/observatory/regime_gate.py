"""Regime gate — only trade in market regimes with a proven edge.

The live diagnosis showed the strategy made 87% of its predictions in the
"CALM" regime, where it was right just 48% of the time — worse than a coin
flip. Trading a regime with no edge only bleeds fees.

This gate consults the strategy's *own* accumulated, out-of-sample accuracy
per regime and blocks new trades in regimes that have proven unprofitable.
A regime with too little history is allowed through — the gate needs
evidence before it judges, and a blocked regime keeps producing (un-traded)
predictions, so its accuracy stays live and the gate can re-open it.

The gate can only suppress a trade, never create one. Paper / simulation
only — it never touches a real order.
