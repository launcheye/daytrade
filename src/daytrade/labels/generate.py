"""Label generation — OFFLINE TRAINING ONLY.

⚠️  Labels look into the FUTURE. Every function here uses ``close.shift(-h)``,
which references bars *after* the labeled bar. That is correct and necessary
for supervised training — and it is exactly why labels must NEVER touch the
online inference path.

Two structural safeguards:

1. The last ``horizon`` rows have no future and therefore get a NaN label.
   Training code drops them. The model is never trained on a bar whose
   outcome is unknown.
2. Nothing in ``daytrade.fusion`` / ``daytrade.cli`` imports this module for
   live decisions — the leakage test suite asserts that.
