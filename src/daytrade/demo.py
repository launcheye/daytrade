"""The canonical demo scenario.

PLAN.md specifies a fixed scenario the platform must reproduce: a calm market
with BTC near 103,434, a bullish macro backdrop, an oversold RSI, and a
sell-heavy orderbook — resolving to a BUY at ~0.60 confidence.

This module builds that scenario deterministically as real market data
(candles + orderbook) so the *actual pipeline* — not a hard-coded answer —
produces the decision. It is a "buy-the-dip" setup: a long, calm uptrend, a
sharp multi-bar pullback (which drives RSI down), then a small bounce.
